# 💰 Session Pricing

Classic WoW Buddy is a personal, one-on-one companion service for World of Warcraft Classic players.
I’m not a booster — I actually play alongside you: questing, chatting, and exploring.

Whether you're a solo player looking for company or returning to Classic WoW after a long break,
these sessions are designed to be relaxing, fun, and pressure-free.

## ⏱ Time Zones & Availability

I'm based in **Thailand (UTC+7)**, which lines up well with many players in the US.

This means I’m usually online when:

- 🌙 **US players** are in the evening (perfect for questing after work)
- 🕐 **US afternoon/midday** hours also work well for me

Use the [Booking page](/booking) to view my live calendar and see available times in *your local time zone*.
